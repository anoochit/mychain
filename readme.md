# mychain
**mychain** is a blockchain built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Starport](https://starport.com).

## Get started

```
starport chain serve
```

`serve` command installs dependencies, builds, initializes, and starts your blockchain in development.

### Configure

Your blockchain in development can be configured with `config.yml`. To learn more, see the [Starport docs](https://docs.starport.com).

### Web Frontend

Starport has scaffolded a Vue.js-based web app in the `vue` directory. Run the following commands to install dependencies and start the app:

```
cd vue
npm install
npm run serve
```

The frontend app is built using the `@starport/vue` and `@starport/vuex` packages. For details, see the [monorepo for Starport front-end development](https://github.com/tendermint/vue).
